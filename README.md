Provenance-first extractive RAG: retrieve documents, select answer-relevant
passages, and return source excerpts with citations instead of freely rewriting
the evidence.

## Concept

Traditional RAG systems retrieve relevant documents and then allow an LLM to
freely generate a response. Verbatim RAG reduces that generative surface by
selecting and displaying passages from retrieved context.

Built-in verified extraction paths return evidence text from the supplied
source. This is a provenance guarantee, not a truth guarantee: retrieval may be
incomplete, a source may be wrong, and an extractor may choose an irrelevant or
incomplete passage. The default contextual template may also generate
presentation text around cited excerpts; use `template_mode="static"` when the
framing must be fixed and deterministic.

On the paper's 100-row ACL-Verbatim benchmark, the 150M-parameter
ACL-specialized model achieved **53.6 micro Word-F1**, compared with **48.7** for
the strongest evaluated LLM extractor. In the generic v2
[model-card evaluation](https://huggingface.co/KRLabsOrg/verbatim-rag-modern-bert-v2),
v2 achieved higher micro Word-F1 than the evaluated Zilliz Semantic Highlight
and Provence baselines on ACL, RAGBench, Squeez, and QASPER slices. See the
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.21102) for the benchmark design and
limitations.

The pipeline can also use local encoder models for retrieval and extraction plus
static rendering, without generative LLM API calls. With SPLADE and
`ModelSpanExtractor`, that configuration supports CPU execution after model
weights are available.

## What "verbatim" means

| Property | Built-in exact/static path | Outside the guarantee |
|---|---|---|
| Evidence text | Returned from retrieved source text | Custom/structured extractors must enforce their own contract |
| Rendering | Exact excerpts plus fixed transparent framing | Contextual mode can generate introductions, labels, and connective text |
| Citations | Source citations and highlights are returned | Repeated identical text can still make source-offset mapping ambiguous |
| Correctness | Provenance can be inspected | Source truth, retrieval recall, relevance, completeness, and entailment |

## Installation

```bash
# Install the package
pip install verbatim-rag
```

For local development:

```bash
pip install -e packages/core/
pip install -e .
```

## Lightweight Core

If you only need the reusable verbatim core without the full RAG pipeline (no torch, transformers, or Milvus):

```bash
pip install verbatim-core
```

```python
from verbatim_core import VerbatimTransform

vt = VerbatimTransform()
response = vt.transform(
    question="What is the main finding?",
    context=[
        {"content": "The study found that X leads to Y.", "title": "Paper A"},
        {"content": "Results show Z is significant.", "title": "Paper B"},
    ],
)
print(response.answer)
```

Dependencies: only `openai`, `pydantic`, `rapidfuzz`, and `jinja2`.

## Quick Start

```python
from verbatim_rag import VerbatimIndex, VerbatimRAG
from verbatim_rag.ingestion import DocumentProcessor
from verbatim_rag.vector_stores import LocalMilvusStore
from verbatim_rag.embedding_providers import SpladeProvider

# Process documents with intelligent chunking
processor = DocumentProcessor()

# Process PDFs from URLs
document = processor.process_url(
    url="https://aclanthology.org/2025.bionlp-share.8.pdf",
    title="KR Labs at ArchEHR-QA 2025: A Verbatim Approach for Evidence-Based Question Answering",
    metadata={"authors": ["Adam Kovacs", "Paul Schmitt", "Gabor Recski"]}
)

# Create embedding provider and vector store
sparse_provider = SpladeProvider(
    model_name="opensearch-project/opensearch-neural-sparse-encoding-doc-v2-distill",
    device="cpu"
)
vector_store = LocalMilvusStore(
    db_path="./index.db",
    collection_name="verbatim_rag",
    enable_dense=False,
    enable_sparse=True,
)

# Create index with providers
index = VerbatimIndex(
    vector_store=vector_store,
    sparse_provider=sparse_provider
)
index.add_documents([document])

# Then query the index
rag = VerbatimRAG(index)

response = rag.query("What is the main contribution of the paper?")
print(response.answer)
```


### Environment Setup

Set your OpenAI API key before using the system:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## How It Works

1. **Document Processing**: Documents are processed using docling for format conversion and chonkie for chunking
2. **Document Indexing**: Documents are indexed using vector embeddings (both dense and sparse)
3. **Template Management**: Response templates are created and stored for common question types
4. **Query Processing**: 
   - Relevant documents are retrieved
   - Key passages are extracted verbatim using either LLM-based or fine-tuned span extractors
   - Responses are structured using templates
   - Citations link back to source documents

The evidence excerpts remain inspectable source text. Retrieval, extraction
quality, and any generated contextual framing remain separate concerns.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **VerbatimRAG** (`verbatim_rag/core.py`): Main orchestrator that coordinates document retrieval, span extraction, and response generation
- **VerbatimIndex** (`verbatim_rag/index.py`): Vector-based document indexing and retrieval
- **SpanExtractor** (`verbatim_rag/extractors.py`): Abstract interface for extracting relevant text spans from documents
  - **LLMSpanExtractor**: Uses OpenAI models to identify relevant spans
  - **ModelSpanExtractor**: Uses fine-tuned BERT-based models for span classification
- **DocumentProcessor** (`verbatim_rag/ingestion/`): Docling + Chonkie integration for intelligent document processing
- **Document** (`verbatim_rag/document.py`): Core document representation with metadata

### Data Flow
1. Documents are processed and chunked using docling and chonkie
2. Documents are indexed using vector embeddings
3. User queries retrieve relevant documents
4. Span extractors identify verbatim passages that answer the question
5. Response templates structure the final answer with citations
6. Responses expose selected source text with document references; guarantee
   details depend on the extractor and template mode described above

## API and web prototype

The repository contains a FastAPI API and Vite/React development UI. They are
not included in the PyPI wheel and are not yet part of the same compatibility
gate as `verbatim-core`. Reproducible local-stack work is tracked in
[#27](https://github.com/KRLabsOrg/verbatim-rag/issues/27), and the document
lifecycle contract is tracked in
[#31](https://github.com/KRLabsOrg/verbatim-rag/issues/31).

## ModernBERT Span Extractor

[KRLabsOrg/verbatim-rag-modern-bert-v2](https://huggingface.co/KRLabsOrg/verbatim-rag-modern-bert-v2) is a 150M-parameter query-conditioned token classifier built on `gte-reranker-modernbert-base`. It supports up to 8,192 tokens and is trained on scientific papers, Wikipedia QA, financial tables, medical literature, legal contracts, product manuals, and code/tool output.

The linked model card reports higher micro Word-F1 than the evaluated Zilliz
Semantic Highlight and Provence baselines on ACL, RAGBench, Squeez, and QASPER
slices. These are extractor evaluations, not end-to-end hallucination rates.

`ModelSpanExtractor` defaults to this model:

```python
from verbatim_rag.core import VerbatimRAG
from verbatim_rag.index import VerbatimIndex
from verbatim_rag.extractors import ModelSpanExtractor
from verbatim_rag.vector_stores import LocalMilvusStore
from verbatim_rag.embedding_providers import SpladeProvider

extractor = ModelSpanExtractor(
    model_path="KRLabsOrg/verbatim-rag-modern-bert-v2",  # default
    threshold=0.2,
    min_span_chars=30,
    merge_gap_chars=20,
    device=None,  # auto-detects cuda, mps, cpu
)

sparse_provider = SpladeProvider(
    model_name="opensearch-project/opensearch-neural-sparse-encoding-doc-v2-distill",
    device="cpu"
)
vector_store = LocalMilvusStore(
    db_path="./index.db",
    collection_name="verbatim_rag",
    enable_dense=False,
    enable_sparse=True,
)
index = VerbatimIndex(vector_store=vector_store, sparse_provider=sparse_provider)

rag_system = VerbatimRAG(
    index=index,
    extractor=extractor,
    template_mode="static",  # no generated contextual framing
    k=5,
)
response = rag_system.query("Main findings of the paper?")
print(response.answer)
```
